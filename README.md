Arduino Project
As a final project for an Internet of Things course I created a remote-timed plant irrigation system. It is currently programmed to water at a specific time everyday. However the code is also written to allow for the soil moisture reading to be taken and watered based on that level, which will be displayed on the LCD screen. To allow for a more user friendly option I have also added in code from IFTTT to send a text message to the user when the soil level is low.
